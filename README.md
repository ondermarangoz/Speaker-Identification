# Speaker-Identification
I implemented this repository from [Spoken Speaker Identification based on Gaussian Mixture Models](https://appliedmachinelearning.blog/2017/11/14/spoken-speaker-identification-based-on-gaussian-mixture-models-python-implementation/)
It works on Python 2.7(It is not guaranteed on Python3+)

### Data-Set
Data-set not included because of its size.
You can download the data from same [website](https://appliedmachinelearning.blog/2017/11/14/spoken-speaker-identification-based-on-gaussian-mixture-models-python-implementation/)
